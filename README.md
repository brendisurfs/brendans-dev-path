my own side learning while attending DevMountain. 

## About

I wanted to really clear up my knowledge in both Typescript and Go. While I could get by with my Typescript knowledge,
I really felt like I could do more to improve my understanding and further my projects.
The reason for adding Go into the equasion is to arm myself with an incredibly unique tool. It really fills in where Python lacks for me.
Before this organized study, I picked up go within a few days and was up and running with simple apps, one being a simple backend for a web app I built. 
But I want to do a lot more with CLI processes, with ideas about directory/dependency management tools and such.
So here we are, can't wait to read and edit this README in 8 weeks and see how far I come.
